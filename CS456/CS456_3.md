*Application Layer*

Principle of network applications

- run on end systems rather than network core devices, communicats over networks.
- allow rapid apps development and propagations.
- the application layer talks to other applications' applications layer.

Two possible structures of applications:
- client-server
- peer to peer (P2P)
___
***Client-server Architectures***

Server: 
- always-on host
- has permanent ip address
- use data center for scaling.

Datacenter: large number of hosts. (Apps running on there:: search engines, e-commerce, social networking...)

clients: 
- communicates with server
- maybe intermittently connectiond
- may have dynamic ip address
- do not communicates directly with each others.

***P2P Architectures***
- no always-on server
- arbitraty end systems can communicates.
- peers request service from other peers, and provide service to other peers
- scalability: new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands.
- peers intermittenly connected and change IP address.


***Processes communication***

Within same host, two process communicates using `inter-processes communication`, which is defined by the OS>. Process that runs on different hosts are communicate via `messaging`.

***Sockets***

process send/receive messages to/from its `socket`
- a application programming interface(API) between appliation laayer and transportation layer(which is controlled by OS)
- analogous to a door, sending process shoves message out door.
- limited control on the transport layer side(can change choice of protocal...)


***Addressing processes***

- process has unique identifiers to receive the messages.
- host device has unique 32 bits IP address 

Is such IP address sufficient for PID? No, many processes can be run on same host at the same time.

Thus, we need a `port`, *IP address + port number --> ID for processes*. For example `192.168.10.145:80`.


***Application layer protocal***

What it should have?
- type of messages exchanged(request? response?)
- message syntax
- message semantics
- rules for when and how to process send & respond messages
- open protocal: HTTP, HTTPs
- proprietary: Skype

What transport service does an app need?

- data integrity(file transfer web application requries 100% reliable data transfer, but audio/video stream apps can tolerates some loss).
- timing (Some apps require low latency to be effective, for example, telephony, interactive network game)
- throughput(see textbook)
- security 

***Internet transport protocols services: TCP and UDP***

TCP service:

workflow: `TCP request->TCP response->request->response...`
- reliable data transfer
- does not provide timing, minimum throughput, security
- congestion control, flow control
- connection-oriented.

UDP service:

- unreliable data transfer
- does not provide flow control, security, timing, congestion control, flow control..

So what is the point for having UDP services?
